## How to Use:
For windows: use the 'client.exe' that is present inside the Win folder. If you donot have any C-compiler installed, keep the 'dll' file in the same folder
where client.exe is stored. The dynamic library is for the using the posix thread.


For Linux: './client' to run the client and './server' to run the server

It is opensource, anyone can clone and edit as per their way.

## I hope you like our project.
